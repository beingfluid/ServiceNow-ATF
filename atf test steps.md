# Create a User

- Create a User dynamically adds a new user, assigns it specified roles, and then (optionally) impersonates the user.
- Once a test completes, the user created is removed.
- To help your tests remain self-contained without dependencies to specific users and roles, it is recommended to use Create a User and impersonate them at the the beginning of a test.
